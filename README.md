# PoolCarz


This website facilitates users in checking available rides from iPlanet to iPlanet, as well as other destinations, and allows them to view the number of rides based on their specific requirements. Users can then proceed to book their preferred ride. Additionally, drivers have the ability to add new ride listings through the "offer ride" feature, thereby enabling users to find available rides and drivers to offer their services for booking.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
